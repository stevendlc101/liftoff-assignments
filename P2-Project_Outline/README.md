## Submission Instructions

### Overview

	The name of my application is Film Friends.  It will be a social networking hub for fans of film to meet other people with similar tastes and cinematic interests, make friends, and find personal movie recommendations.  Many sites today have corporate interests behind them or use simple algorithms to suggest films with the same directors or films that star the same performers.
	With Film Friends, fans of any genre of film can build a personal list of their favorite movies, make recommendations to others for similar films, and find fans of their favorite movies.  Users can build up a network of genre experts, movie junkies, or just simple cinema fans, and search this network of people to find movie gems that they have never heard of and add them to their list of movies to watch.

### Features

Log-In & Personal Profile Page
	Users will create an individual log-in and be directed to their personal profile.  Their profile will have a list of “Favorite Films” and a list of “Films to Watch,” both that the user can manipulate and edit.  Favorite Films will also be individually ratable. If an individual likes they can also provide personal details and a link to their own film blog or fan page.

Search
	Users can search the database for specific movies. Each film will have an individual page that contains director and original release date information. Users can also see others who have added this particular film to their favorites list.

Recommendations
Registered users can access the page for an individual movie and add to the list of similar films.  They can also use criteria to quantify their recommendations (i.e. similar story, character types, aesthetics, themes, etc.).

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will also need to figure out how users can "friend" each other.
